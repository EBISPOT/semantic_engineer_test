# Semantic Data Engineer: Knowledge test

The following tests your knowledge and problem-solving mindset. Figuring out how much or how little detail to provide to answer each question well is part of the exercise! You will be doing a lot of empirical evaluation thinking as part of the job, so you should feel comfortable to formulate some ideas even if you are not familiar with the domain (medical, etc).

## Reflection on your technical task

*As part of your technical task, you have developed a simple CLI tool that obtains phenotypes from an API and computes a basic Jaccard score. This score is intended to reflect the similarity between two diseases. Make a few suggestions for how we could improve the score. For example, how might we take into account semantic relationships in the ontologies when computing similarity?

## Data-driven thinking

*We frequently evaluate algorithms using computational benchmarks. Give us a few examples of how the choice of dataset for the evaluation can impact the results of the evaluation.*

Your answer here.

*Assume you are charged with evaluating a few algorithms, but there is no real data nor gold standard corpora available. How would you proceed?*

Your answer here.

*What can we do to ensure the evaluation is reproducible?"

## Empirical thinking

*You are charged with evaluating how changes in your data or knowledge graph affect algorithms for medical diagnosis. Independent of whether you have experience with these algorithms, how would design a framework to evaluate the effect these changes in the data have on the performance of the algorithms? Please provide at least one (hypothetical) example.*

Your answer here.

*As an additional layer of complication to the above question, assume that all algorithms used in your evaluation are implemented in different programming languages with different CLIs. How would you handle this situation?*

## Socio-technical issue

*How would you present the results of a benchmark like the one described in the section on "Empirical Thinking" above to domain experts? What do you think would interest them the most? You can think of a medical expert, but any domain expert is ok to consider as an example.*
